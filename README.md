Qnapdisplay
==

Qnap lcd display python module, features both writing to the display as wel as reading keypresses from the panel keys.
It was developed on a Qnap TS-459 and TS-453A, but it will most likely also work on some other models as well.

Module install
==

```bash
sudo pip install git+https://github.com/bkram/qnapdisplay.git
```

Future
==
As my own lcd display has died, someone please send me a new one ;) as encouragement, However presently I can no longer maintain it myself, contributions are of course welcomed.
